    "\n",
    "To answer this RQ the following notebook does the following:\n",
    "- Load the baseline CNN, baseline CBM and FuzzyLoss CBM\n",
    "- Load the GTSRB test set\n",
    "- For each model calculate the test set label accuracy, f1 score, auc one-vs-all score\n",
    "- Calculate concept level accuracy, f1 score and auc one-vs-all scores for the concepts\n",
    "- Plot the convergence of during training of baseline CBM and fuzzy loss cbm"
