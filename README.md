# Leveraging Domain Requirements in Concept Based Models via Differentiable Fuzzy Logic

## 🧠 Overview

This repository provides an implementation of the paper *"Leveraging Domain Requirements in Concept Based Models via Differentiable Fuzzy Logic"*.  The goal of this project is to provide full access to the research results, by following the principles of transparency, reproducibility and replicability.

> **Abstract:**  
> Designers of machine learning (ML) enabled systems often assume that training datasets implicitly capture all domain requirements. However, models may learn spurious correlations rather than the true underlying domain logic, leading to unreliable behavior. This is particularly concerning in safety-critical domains due to the potentially significant consequences. We address this challenge by introducing ReqAware, which directly integrates domain requirements during training, to ensure models learn them directly instead of assuming implicit capture by the dataset. We use the explainable Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) interface to express domain requirements in terms of interpretable concepts. Formal requirements in First Order Logic over such concepts translate into differentiable expressions using Fuzzy Logic for enforcement during training. We present preliminary results of ReqAware in the computer vision domain applied to the  German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and Belgium Traffic Sign (BTS) datasets. By eliciting domain requirements from GTSRB, we demonstrate improved robustness and conformance to the expressed requirements.

## 🚀 Usage

### Train a Baseline CNN model

```bash
python src/train.py --config_file /path/to/config.yaml
```

### Train a ReqAware model

```bash
python src/train_cbm.py --config_file /path/to/config.yaml
```

### Evaluate the model

```bash
make reproduce-experiments
```
Afterwards, run files Notebooks/RQ1.ipynb and Notebooks/RQ2_3.ipynb

## 🔍 Extended Work (Optional)

This codebase can be easily tweaked to work with new datasets and new sets of requirements. For example:

- New datasets can be created by developing a data factory to handle its reading and adding them to the registry.
- New requirements can be implemented by using the Fuzzy transformations inside src/models/loss/fuzzy_transformations.py and by placing them in custom_rules.py
